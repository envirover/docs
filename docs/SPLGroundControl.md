# SPLGroundControl

SPL is a communication technology designed to:
* Track position, attitude, and velocity of your drones anywhere on Earth;
* Monitor vital signs signs of your drone, such as battery charge, system status, and temperature;
* Update missions, parameters, and send commands to your drone;
* Control gymbals, and RC servos connected to AutoPilot.

SPLGroundControl is a MAVLink proxy server for ArduPilot drones that uses Iridium sort burst data (ISBD) satellite communication system provided by [RockBLOCK](http://www.rock7mobile.com/products-rockblock) unit. It is designed to work with [SPLRadioRoom](https://github.com/envirover/SPLRadioRoom) field application, providing two way communication channel between ArduPilot based drones and MAVLink ground control stations such as MAVProxy, Mission Planer, or QGroundControl.

### SPLGroundControl Installation and Use

The machine that runs SPLGroundControl must be accessible from the Internet. Port 8080 must be accessible from RockBLOCK services, and port 5760 must be accessible from the ground control station client machines.

SPLGroundControl installation instructions for different environments are available on [wiki](https://github.com/envirover/SPLGroundControl/wiki) pages. Probably the easiest way to get started with SPLGroundControl is to [deploy it on Amazon AWS](https://github.com/envirover/SPLGroundControl/wiki/SPLGroundControl-Installation-on-Amazon-AWS).

Once SPLGroundControl is started, you can connect to it from MAVProxy, Mission Planer, or QGroundControl using TCP connection on port 5760. For example, MAVPoxy ground control could be connected this way: 

``mavproxy.py --master=tcp:<IP>:5760 --mav10``

Currently SPLGroundControl supports one GCS client connection at a time.

## SPLStream and SPLTracks

SPLStream and SPLTracks web services provide a solution for storing and visualizing data reported by SPLRadioRoom. See [SPLStream and SPLTracks wiki page](https://github.com/envirover/SPLGroundControl/wiki/SPLStream-and-SPLTracks-Web-Services) for more information on deployment and use of these web services.
