Envirover provides a range of telemetry solutions for all kinds of autonomous vehicles.


## SPL Global Telemetry 

[SPL global telemetry system](spl.html) uses Iridium short burst data (SBD) satellite communication technology provided by [Rock Seven Mobile](http://www.rock7mobile.com/). 

Using SPL you can track, command, and control your solar powered boats, planes, and other autonomous vehicle with [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) or [PX4](http://px4.io/) autopilots from the other side of the Earth. 

The system supports  [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/) and [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) ground control stations (GCS) and also provides web services for storing and visualizing telemetry data in web applications.


## NVI BLOS Telemetry 

[NVI BLOS telemetry](nvi.html) is designed to work with satellite or cellular modems such as [Iridium GO!](https://www.iridium.com/products/details/iridiumgo).

NVI provides peer-to-peer communication between an autonomous vehicle with [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) or [PX4](http://px4.io/) autopilots and [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/) or [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) ground control station.
