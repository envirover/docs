SPL and NVI are global satellite telemetry solution for unmanned vehicles controlled by [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) or [PX4](http://px4.io/) autopilot. 
With SPL or NVI you can control your unmanned vehicle on the other side of the Earth almost the same way you would with radio telemetry. 

With SPL or NVI you can:
- Track position, attitude, and velocity of your vehicles anywhere on Earth.
- Monitor vital signs of your vehicles, such as battery charge, system status, and temperature.
- Update on-board parameters and send commands and missions to your vehicles using popular ground control stations such as Mission Planner or QGrouindControl.
- Control gymbals, and RC servos connected to autopilots.

## SPL Global Telemetry

[SPL](spl.html) uses Iridium short burst data (SBD) satellite communication technology provided by [Rock Seven Mobile](http://www.rock7mobile.com/). 

Because of high latency and low bandwidth of Iridium SBD, SPL does not support video streaming. 

## NVI BLOS Telemetry 

[NVI](nvi.html) is designed for satellite or cellular communication over TCP/IP protocol.
