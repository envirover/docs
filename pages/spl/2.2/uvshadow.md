UV Shadow is a database that stores desired and reported states of the unmanned vehicle and MAVLink messages sent to and received from the vehicle.

In SPL 2.1 and 2.2 UV Shadow uses [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) engine. Future SPL releases might use other database engines for storing UV Shadow data.
